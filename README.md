# [ICS33 Grade Viewer](https://chasec99.github.io/ICS33-Grade-Viewer/)
This website allows students in Pattis's ICS 33 class to view their grades online.  
While the information on this site should be up-to-date, we cannot guarantee it.
For the most accurate information, please visit the [ICS 33 website](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/ICS-33/)

### How It Works
When the ICS33 Grade Viewer loads, it downloads the current *Grades* file from the ICS 33 website.
The *Grades* file is a zipped .xslm file.
The ICS 33 Grade Viewer unzips this file and then converts it to a JSON object.
